# LLM Interpretability

A research project focused on understanding and interpreting the inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Overview

This project aims to develop tools and methodologies for interpreting how large language models process information, make decisions, and generate outputs. By gaining deeper insights into LLM behavior, we can improve model transparency, safety, and reliability.

## Goals

- **Mechanistic Interpretability**: Understand the internal mechanisms and circuits within transformer-based language models
- **Feature Visualization**: Identify and visualize learned features and representations
- **Activation Analysis**: Analyze neuron activations and their semantic meanings
- **Behavior Explanation**: Explain model predictions and decision-making processes
- **Safety & Alignment**: Use interpretability insights to improve model safety and alignment

## Key Areas of Research

### 1. Attention Mechanisms
- Analyzing attention patterns across layers
- Understanding how models route information
- Visualizing attention heads and their roles

### 2. Neural Activation Studies
- Identifying interpretable neurons and features
- Analyzing activation patterns for specific inputs
- Feature extraction and clustering

### 3. Circuit Discovery
- Finding algorithmic circuits within models
- Understanding how models implement specific behaviors
- Mapping computational subgraphs

### 4. Probing and Analysis
- Linear probing of intermediate representations
- Causal intervention experiments
- Ablation studies
